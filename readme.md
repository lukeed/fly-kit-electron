## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/lukeed/fly-kit-electron
npm install
npm start
```

> **Pro Tip:** Use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install NPM dependencies 3x faster than NPM!


## Commands

#### build

```
$ npm run build
```

Compiles all files. Output is sent to the `dist` directory.

#### release

```
$ npm run release
```

Builds the app for OS X, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).

#### start

```
$ npm start
```

Executes [`build`](#build) and runs your Electron application from the `dist` directory.

#### test

```
$ npm run test
```

Lints all JavaScript files.

#### watch

```

```

Like [`start`](#start), but will auto-compile & auto-reload the server after any file changes within the `src` directory.
